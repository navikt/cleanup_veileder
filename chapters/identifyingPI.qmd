# How do you identify the elements in a text that can disclose personal information? {#sec-identifyingPI}

Here we discuss how disclosive elements can be found.

Integrating som python code as an example

## A simple example using native NER model in Spacy

Let us define a simple function that takes a string and returns a dataframe holding the NER counts in that string.

{{< embed example_notebook.ipynb#simple-NER-count echo=true >}}


Now let us define a string that contains elements we want the NER-model to identify:

{{< embed example_notebook.ipynb#example-string >}}


Now let us apply the function we defined above on this string to see how many named entities it recognises:

{{< embed example_notebook.ipynb#NER-example >}}
